### Smarter Stormwater Management in Fairfax County

Stormwater Management is important in Fairfax County because when it rains heavily on impervious surfaces like building roofs and asphalt the water rushes into storm drains instead of percolating into the ground.  The rapidly moving water erodes our streams and scours out the aquatic life in the streams. Erosion also carries sediment and associated nutrients into the Potomac River, and eventually the Chesapeake Bay, making it tougher to restore the natural resources of the Bay, which we cherish. Fairfax County has 30 watersheds, each with a management plan listing often dozens of potential projects, but those projects are not ranked.  About a third of our Countyâ€™s watersheds are in good shape, a third of them are not too bad, but another third are in truly bad shape.  As a Director of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, I will advocate that the Board prioritize its efforts, and encourage other County agencies to also prioritize their efforts, on our watersheds that are in the worst shape. We should also cooperate with local communities within those especially stressed watersheds, and give priority to those viable projects that will produce the greatest environmental benefit for the available dollars. Finally, we need to measure the success of these projects, and communicate the project results to the public.
