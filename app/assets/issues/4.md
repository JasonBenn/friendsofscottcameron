### Candidate Scott Cameron Supports Rescue Reston

I support the concerned Reston citizens of the grass roots Rescue Reston organization.  Rescue Reston is trying to protect open space in Reston at Reston National Golf Course.  This 166 acre property provides environmental benefits and is an important asset contributing to the property values of Reston homeowners. The life insurance company that now owns the golf course wants to convert the golf course into residential development.  This proposed residential development is contrary to the Fairfax County Comprehensive Plan and the Reston Master Plan.  It would be bad for the environment of Fairfax County, and bad for the Reston community.

I believe that the opinions of the citizens of Fairfax County must matter.  Our environment must matter.  Our homeowner property rights must matter.  I am committed to protecting our property rights and our environment, and stand firmly with Rescue Reston!
