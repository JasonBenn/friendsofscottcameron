### Cameron opposes extended operation of the Lorton Landfill

The Lorton Landfill has been in operation for many years, and is now scheduled to close in 2018.  The nature of the Lorton area has changed dramatically since the landfill first opened, and I believe continuing operation of a landfill in the area beyond its scheduled closing date is no longer compatible with the future needs of the community. The local citizen’s association, the South County Federation, has adopted a resolution opposing the Landfill’s expansion and prolonged operation into 2025 or beyond.  I believe it is important for elected leaders to respect the views of the community.
