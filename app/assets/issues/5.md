### Candidate Scott Cameron Supports Spring Bank Communityâ€™s Effort to Protect Woodland

The Spring Bank community in the Mount Vernon Magisterial District wants the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to transfer nine acres of county-owned woodlands to the Fairfax County Park Authority as a future park for the people of the area.  I strongly support their efforts.  This land, known as the Fairchild property, has historic Civil War Era significance and environmental values that deserve to be protected.  This property has been owned by Fairfax County since 2009, and was once actually zoned as park land.  Until it is turned over to the Park Authority to be maintained forever as a recreational and environmental amenity, there is a real risk that this open space will be lost as the population in the Mount Vernon area continues to grow and development pressures increase.

Please join me in signing a petition that has already been signed by hundreds of our fellow Fairfax County residents to urge the Board of Supervisors to protect this valuable woodland by transferring it to the Fairfax County Park Authority.
