### Invasive Species in Fairfax County

Invasive species are a significant environmental problem in Fairfax County.  Invasive plants like hydrilla clog our lakes and streams, making boating, swimming, and fishing less enjoyable.  Invasive plants such as English ivy and multiflora rose are transforming our forests and parks, choking out our native plant species and damaging wildlife habitat and recreational values. Invasive insects like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle, which have killed millions of treasured neighborhood shade trees in the northeast and Midwest and damaged suburban property values, pose a threat to the beauty of our Fairfax neighborhoods and our property values.

As an elected member of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board, Scott Cameron will work to:

* Focus the Board’s technical assistance on helping landowners identify and manage invasive species that are harming Fairfax County landscapes
* Promote the use of native plants in gardening and landscaping to reduce the risks of invasive plants spreading into our fields, forests, and waters
* Team with other county, state, and federal agencies, landowners, and non-profit organizations to take an integrated multi-stakeholder approach to protecting our watershed and plant and animal communities from invasive species
* Change any outdated Virginia state government policies that discourage the use of the Board’s cost-share grant programs from tackling invasive problems in Fairfax County
