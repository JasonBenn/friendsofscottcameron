### Keeping Fairfax’s Environmental Dollars in Fairfax

The state’s Soil and Water Conservation Boards were first established when most of Virginia, including Fairfax County, were rural areas with widespread agricultural operations.  But a lot has changed in Fairfax County since the 1940s.  Unfortunately, the rules for program eligibility for cost-share grants have not kept up. As a result, the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board has repeatedly had a hard time finding Fairfax County projects that meet the outdated grant criteria, even though our environmental problems are very real and desperately in need of attention. In fact, in each of the last two years the Board has given away $100,000 of your grant money to projects in neighboring more rural counties because of these outdated rules. If the policy coming out of Richmond or Washington DC fails to meet our needs in Fairfax County, we can no longer accept that.  We need to change the policy, and stop giving away your money. 

As an elected member of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board, Scott Cameron will work to:

* Change outdated policies so we can spend all the conservation grant funds to which Fairfax County is entitled on deserving environmental improvement projects in Fairfax County
* Ensure that the available funding, even under the old policies, has the best chance of being spent meaningfully in Fairfax County by actively advertising the availability of funding through a competitive process so all eligible projects have a chance to compete for funding
