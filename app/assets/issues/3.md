### Maximizing Fairfax Environmental Benefits from Your Taxes

The Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board has a small but dedicated staff of technical experts who provide advice to landowners, and the ability to tap into state and federal cost-sharing grant funds for conservation projects. Fairfax County is a large place, with some of its watersheds in relatively good condition, and some watersheds in very poor condition. What the Board is missing is a more rigorous and strategic approach to how it spends it resources, your tax money. 

As an elected member of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board, Scott Cameron will work to:

* Focus the Board’s technical assistance and grant money on watersheds across the County that are in the poorest shape, where the Board’s efforts can produce the greatest environmental benefits for the effort expended, so Fairfax County taxpayers get the most for their money
* Require that each project funded by the Board indicate the projected environmental benefits of the project, preferably in quantitative terms, and then report on the results actually achieved when the project is completed
* Team with other county, state, and federal agencies, landowners, and non-profit organizations to take an integrated multi-stakeholder approach to protecting our watersheds so that we can effectively stretch our budget through teaming
