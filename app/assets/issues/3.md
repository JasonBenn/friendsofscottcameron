### Cameron Calls on County to Save the Trees of Dead Run in McLean Central Park

Fairfax County is moving to "restore" the portion of Dead Run that runs through McClean Central Park.  Its initial plan called for cutting down most of the trees in the floodplain. While the County has started to backtrack due to citizen opposition, the entire process has been problematic.  The County has never satisfactorily explained why this particular stretch of Dead Run is a higher priority for restoration than the many other impaired streams in the County.  The County should have much more effectively and much earlier done outreach with affected homeowners, and not tried to impose on them a "done deal".  The County should have engaged the community from the very beginning in a discussion of alternative approaches for a restoration project.  Finally, the County has now so diminished trust with the community, that there needs to be an independent technical review of whatever plan the County finally decides to pursue.  If elected, I would work to develop a transparent and scientifically defensible process for ranking the hundreds of possible water quality projects across Fairfax County, and promote much earlier and more meaningful community involvement in the decision-making process.
